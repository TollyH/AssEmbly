# AssEmbly Formal Grammar Definitions

Formal grammar definitions for the AssEmbly programming language written in BNF (Backusâ€“Naur form).

`GrammarGeneric` defines the general syntax of the language that should remain mostly consistent between versions, whereas `GrammarStrict` also defines valid mnemonic and operand combinations, which will be updated whenever more are added. Neither define integer limits or a requirement for label names to be defined if they are referenced.
