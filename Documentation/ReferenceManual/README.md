# AssEmbly Reference Manual

The AssEmbly reference manual contains detailed instructions on how to use the AssEmbly programming language. It aims to explain every aspect of the language and architecture in a way that is understandable and useful to both beginners and advanced users of the language alike. It is **not** a formal specification of either the language or the architecture.

The reference manual file in this folder is under constant development, and may not necessarily be suitable for use with any currently released version of the language. You should instead use the zipped reference manual files provided alongside whichever release build you are using. These are also available in additional formats built from the original markdown file.
