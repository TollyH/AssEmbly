# AssEmbly Reference Manual

The AssEmbly reference manual contains detailed instructions on how to use the AssEmbly programming language. It aims to explain every aspect of the language and architecture in a way that is understandable and useful to both beginners and advanced users of the language alike. It is **not** a formal specification of either the language or the architecture.

The contents of the files in this folder are all equal, they differ only in format.

`ReferenceManual.md` is used as the source file when building the documentation.
